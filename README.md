My name is Wooseong Park. It means a helping star⭐. It's also my nickname.

I am interested in **RL**, especially **Game AI**. I enjoy implementing the game as a RL environment and clearing it with AI.

I also write about what I have studied on my [**Blog**](https://helpingstar.github.io/) in Korean.

My dream is to write a book about what I know.
